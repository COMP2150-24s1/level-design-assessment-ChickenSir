# COMP2150  - Level Design Document
### Name: Aaron Wilson
### Student number: 47539615

This document discusses and reflects on the design of your platformer level for the Level Design assessment. It should be 1500 words. Make sure you delete this and all other instructional text throughout the document before checking your word count prior to submission. Hint: You can check word count by copying this text into a Word or Google doc.

Your document must include images. To insert an image into your documentation, place it in the "DocImages" folder in this repo, then place the below text where you want the image to appear:

## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)
Outline and justify how your level design facilitates the core player experience goals outlined in the assignment spec. Each section should be supported by specific examples and screenshots of your game encounters that highlight design choices made to facilitate that particular experience.

### 1.1. Discovery
What does the player learn? How does your encounter and broader level design facilitate learning in a way that follows good design practice?

### 1.2. Drama
What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief? 

### 1.3. Challenge
What are the main challenges? How have you designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel?

### 1.4. Exploration
How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places?

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Acid and Checkpoints

Understanding how checkpoints work is crucial for players as it plays into the intensity curve and provides peroids of relief. For this reason, it was important that checkpoints were introduced with a hazardous mechanic. 

Acid was chosen for this as it essentially acts as a hard reset for players in the game, either reseting their progress or reverting them to a previous checkpoint. By having Acid and Checkpoints introduced in a single encounter, it allows players to safely investigate the properties of Acid while being given a saftey net.

### 2.2. Chompers

### 2.3. Health Pickups

### 2.4. Keys

Keys are required to open the final door to proceed to the next level, for this reason I chose to place a key behind a door with a switch to open it. I chose to introduce keys this way so that players draw a connection between keys and doors, as collecting three keys is required to progress to the next level.

### 2.5. Moving Platforms and Spikes

Moving platforms are a method of transportation for the player to be carried from one point in the game world to another. As such, it is important that they are introduced with another mechanic that encourages players to use them.

For this reason, spikes are introduced to the player with moving platforms. It provides the player with a hazardous encounter, and provides them with a solution to overcome the encounter. Players will recognise moving platorms as a means of transportation through areas a player otherwise may not be able to progress through.

### 2.6. Passthrough Platforms

### 2.7. Spitters

### 2.8. Weapon Pickup (Gun)

### 2.9. Weapon Pickup (Staff)

## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

### 3.2. Level Map – Section 1

### 3.3.	Level Map – Section 2

### 3.4.	Level Map – Section 3

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design.

### Tool Used: ChatGPT
**Nature of Use** Finding relevant design theory.

**Evidence Attached?** Screenshot of ChatGPT conversation included in the folder "GenAI" in this repo.

**Additional Notes:** I used ChatGPT to try and find some more relevant design theory that I could apply to my game. After googling them, however, I found most of them were inaccurate, and some didn't exist. One theory mentioned, however, was useful, and I've incorporated it into my work.
